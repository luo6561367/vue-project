1. Migration Timeline:
The migration will be implemented in the near future. We will announce the specific timeline and procedures through our official channels. Please stay tuned for updates.


2. Asset Security:
Your assets will remain secure during this transition. We will provide detailed instructions to assist users in completing the migration process.


3. Liquidity Support:
Sufficient liquidity will be maintained on the BSC chain to ensure stable and efficient transactions for our community members.


4. Ongoing Support:
If you have any questions or concerns during the migration process, please do not hesitate to contact us through official channels. Our team is committed to supporting you throughout this transition.



We deeply appreciate your trust and support for the Trustbase project. This migration is aimed at meeting the evolving needs of our community and driving the long-term growth of our ecosystem.
